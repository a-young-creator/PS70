#### Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication

September 28, 2023

This week really felt like when the rubber hits the road. Work began to pile up across all of my courses, and some personal life things got in the way. That being said, I'm weirdly grateful for the challenge this posed. I was forced to do something I am not always the best at- staying calm and working efficiently. I missed class on Tuesday and spent my weekend in Connecticut with family. It helped a lot that I was excited by my orginal idea to create a kinetic sculpture of fireflies floating around in a jar. I wanted to design a parallel planetary gear system and prop up fireflies figures on wires from each gear, so that each one would follow the cycloid traced by the gear, which I hoped would simulate some randomness among the movement of each firefly.

Even though my lab group is on Thursdays, I stayed during Tuesday's lab and toiled away on Fusion while my classmates practiced programming Arduinos. I told myself I would just stay until I could model all my gears correctly... In reality, I stayed until 7:30 and managed not only to model, but to laser cut all of my main components. Kassia and Bobby helped a lot, and at the end of the night, despite having an awful headache, I was more satisfied than I've been with my work in a long time.

More life happened on Wednesday when I thought I would be returning to the lab. Enter today, Thursday. I got to the lab around noon and spent the whole afternoon preceding class working on fabrication and assembly. The most tedious part was (fortunately) peeling the backing from all of the acrylic gears. I did hit one major snag... I spent so much time on Tuesday thinking of how the gears and the housings would lay relative to each other so that the various wires could stick up through the mechanisms. I did not consider that the gears being different circumfrences would mean they would process at different rates, making intersections inevitable without a total redesign. Here's the positive spin: I've identified what will be a pretty simple fix in the printing process to create a new model that achieves my firefly vision. In the meantime, I am going to take advantage of the clear acrylic and the the beautiful layering to turn this iteration into a fish pond, with my favorite fish - cardinal tetra - swimming around in circles. Updates to come.
