#### Week 6: Electronic Input Devices

This week ended up being VERY important for me over the course of the semester. Capacitive touch made up the bulk of the coding and structural work that I needed to accomplish for my final project.

I will admit, I faltered here with my documentation on account of how fixated I became on mastering capactitive touch for my final project. In this week, I built a quick temperature sensor, but failed to take a photo of the circuit before disassembling it. I will be doing my best to get back in to recreate the circuit for my documentation before the due date.

I experimented with various different types of capacitive touch, and I settled on the circuit structure shown below as the skeleton of everything I created afterwards.

I got familiar with reading the serial output graphs, which became very helpful as I ran into an (actually pretty funny) hiccup with my final project later. As you can see in the gif below, touching the copper results in a spike higher, rather than lower. Looking back now, I notice that the copper was resting on my laptop as I tested this. This is probably how I missed the problem the first day I built this circuit... I made a capacitive touch sensor that required the user to be grounded in order to use it.

Despite this, the circuit worked well, and so I quickly extrapolated it into an MVP for my touch piano. At this point in the semester, I decided what I wanted the interface to look like, so I went to the vinyl cutter and cut out copper film into my desired shape. I mounted it on cardboard, connected it to my circuit, and toyed around with altering the code. More on this process in the next section, "Electronic Output Devices.""
