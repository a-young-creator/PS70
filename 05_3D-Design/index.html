#### Week 5: 3D Design and 3D Printing

This week was both incredibly fun and incredibly rewarding for me. Not only did I get to create my very first 3D prints ever- I was able to make my own original design and accomplished some rapid iteration with it. Before I set out on printing an original design, however, I wanted to make sure I knew how to work the printer and the software. One trip to Thingiverse and one false start loading the incorrect filament later, et voila! The world's smallest Bulbasaur.

After this success, I decided to start a very personal project: a keychain built to hold recovery coins for those in Alcoholics Anonymous. I have a few family members who are involved with a program, and preceding this week I discovered a friend fo mine had chosen to begin the program for the first time. This project served as a great way to make something truly meaningful to me while admittedly distracting me from worrying about my friend.

Pictured above is the first iteration. I was vrey proud of myself for my improvements in Fusion360 that allowed me to bring this idea to life. I even successfully created a snap fit mechanism to allow this keychain to encompass a recovery coin. However, this first version did not take into account how PET filament settles and spreads as it cools. The distortion is minute, but this design was small and precise enough that it prevented the two halves from closing completely when the coin was inside.

Fortunately, this was an easy enough fix. By making the inner ring both taller and wider by about 2mm, I was able to successfully snap the two halves closed. For good measure, I also made the snap closure on this version go further around the bottom of the coin to make it more secure. Every time I open this keychain, I am always pleasantly surprised how durable the PET is. Opening the snapfit makes it feel like it is going to snap, and it never does.

One element of the assignment that I still needed to address was post-processing. We learned how to cast and mold, vaccuum seal, and make epoxy composites. I couldn't quite see how any of these were a necessary step for this specific project. So, I went in a different direction.

I designed and 3D printed a model for chocolates that have mine and my fianc√©'s initials on them. Once I had these models, I took them to the vacuum sealer to make chocolate molds. It took me a few trys to get a seal that captured enough detail to be satisfying. At Nathan's suggestion, I eventually poked holes in each of the models to allow more air to be pulled out, getting a more detailed impression. Below is a close-up of the final impression I was satisfied with.
