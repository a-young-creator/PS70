### About Me

<img src="IMG_4141.JPG"width="350">

My name is Adelaide Young. I am a master's student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, studying Learning Design, Innovation, and Technology. I received my Bachelors of Music in 2020 from the College-Conservatory of Music in my native Cincinnati, OH, where I majored in music education while receiving classical training as a clarinetist and conductor. Before arriving at Harvard, I was a public school band director and music teacher for three years.

I have a deep passion for creating learning materials and experiences that foster deep, intrinsic curiosity and enthusiam for life. While music is my primary area of content expertise, I am inspired and excited by interdisciplinary learning designs that blur the barriers between art and science. I believe that to love learning is to love life, and that access to quality education is an unalienable right of all people. 

I currently reside in Belmont, MA, with my two cats, Nimbus and Columbia. Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy cooking, baking, visual art, and any sort of activity that brings me out into nature. In addition to the clarinet, I enjoy playing flute and saxophone, and I am currently teaching myself how to play the mandolin.
