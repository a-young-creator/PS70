#### Week 11: Project Development

On this page, I will be recording the progress I've made on my project throughout the semester. This page also will also serve as the resource page for everything needed to create this project.

## Materials:

- Arduino Uno
- Adafruit MP121 CapTouch Board x2
- Solderable Breadboard
- Small piezo buzzer
- Copper film
- Vinyl
- Wire
- Non-conductive surface (I used cast acrylic)

## The Inspiration:

When I started this course, I knew I wanted to develop something that could be used as an educational tool, hopefully in a music class. With this in mind, I reached out to my former co-teacher in Cincinnati, Dave Kauffman. Dave told me that he always thought it would be cool to expand the kinds of MIDI instruments available for musicians and students to use. The standard MIDI synth is a keyboard; he imagined one as a xylophone, so elementary aged students could record their music directly into their chromebooks.

Now, I am obsessed with this idea and I still hope to develop it. In early conversations with the TFs and Nathan, I realized that a project of that nature would involve higher level code than what we would develop in class this semester. It was my choice if I wanted to focus on the code as the main challenge of my project or to take another direction. Additionally, Nathan also said something that really stuck with me. He told me that I was now a musician and a designer- how many other people could say that? He continued to say he had long be interested in seeing how a musician would innovate a musical interface when given the tools and skills. Why does it have to look like a piano or a xylophone? Why can't it be something completely new and innovative?

Taking on this challenge meant setting aside the idea of this project being immediately useful to my former students, but I was very excited to stretch myself. My journey on this degree has been one of reclaiming my passions and building a professional persona in which I could exercise them all, and this seemed like a fantastic opportunity to do just that.

## The Theory

So, I went back to my roots as a musician. For quite awhile, I considered going to graduate school for ethnomusicology (the study of world music.) I am very passionate about the diversity and history of music throughout humanity. While in undergraduate, in addition to Western music theory and history, I made a point to study non-Western music. I did my senior project on expanding the wind ensemble canon to include more culturally diverse composers, studied clarinet repetoire imbued in the styles of Eastern European Klezmer music and Middle Eastern duduk, and took a course on traditional South Indian tabla.

In reflecting on all this experience, I began to question why we use the piano as such as universal instrument. The piano and Western music theory evolved together, in a way. The only notes present on the piano are the 12-tones used across the Western scales, and they are arranged in such a way to favor the C major scale. That is why there are two instances where there is no black key between white keys. Those are what music theorists call "the natural half steps" in Western music. In a C major scale, the scale with no sharps or flats, there are two halfsteps that make it sound "major." They exist between B and C, and E and F.

As a result, the interval between any two adjacent white keys or black keys on the piano is NOT constant (tonally or spatially), which makes some scales and modes harder to visualize and play on the keyboard. Additionally, this causes transposition, the act of changing a song into a different key, can result in drastic changes in how the song is placed on the keyboard. So, even those songs from other tonalities that do have all their notes represented on the keyboard can become less easy to play or visualize on the keyboard.

In extreme cases, songs from other music traditions that are close to fitting the keyboard notes, but are not exact, have been subtly changed over time to fit the notes present on the keyboard. For instance, many folk songs sung by the African people enslaved in America were sung in keys closely resembling a pentatonic scale, but are not quite exact. In order for theorists and musicologists to recreate these songs on a piano, the standard instrument for studying theory and musicology, they have to alter the song in order to replicate it on the piano. Over time, we run the risk of losing these unique tonalities if we are repeatedly assimilating them into a different tradition.

All of this being said, here is what I imagined:

How might we design a keyboard interface that...
    - consistently and proportionately displays intervals between notes
    - includes the microtonal notes present in a broad range of global tonalities
    - explores affordances we are currently unable to conceptualize with the traditional piano keyboard
    - utilizes MIDI to allow for direct recording and manipulation of sound
