#### Week 4: Microcontrollers 

This week was my first ever foray into coding a machine and manufacturing my own circuits. When I was in high school physics, I did pretty well in class except for the electronics unit, so I felt like this was the beginning of my redemption arc in the world of electrical engineering. Below is a photo of one of the first functioning circuits I constructed in class (a basic pull-up circuit.)

Then I switced over to LEDs. I found this was a really good exercise to practice manipulating code quickly and confidently to achieve my desired results. In this example, I coded for the LED to flash an "SOS" signal.
